This repository contains software created by videoDAC, for the android operating system.

It contains a code template, to allow anyone to launch a [Pay-to-play **Consumer** App for consuming livestream content, and sending payments.](https://github.com/videoDAC/android/blob/master/consumer/README.md).

Livestream content is served to the Consumer app from a [simple-streaming-server](https://github.com/videoDAC/simple-streaming-server).

[The code is open-source an published here](https://github.com/videoDAC/android/tree/master/consumer)

Payments are cleared via cryptocurrency payment networks based on the Ethereum ecosystem, i.e. via addresses starting with `0x`.

The app has been tested against Ethereum (Layer 1), and Matic (Layer 2).
